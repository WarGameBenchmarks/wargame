Languages
=========

WarGame has been implemented in various languages over the last few years. Here is a brief description of those languages, and their highlights.

A few things to keep in mind:

- WarGame is only kinda-sorta a benchmark, and as such, it is not to be taken too seriously
- WarGame supports multi-threading
- WarGame is not very computationally intensive; it is not performing many *floating point operations*, and thus it is not a substitute to something like [Prime95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime95)

Java
----

Java has great benefits! Cross-thread communication is trivially easy with Java, among other aspects of multi-threading such as the ease in which threads can be created by extending [Runnable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html). That is a great perk. Java also benefits from cross-platform support. Because of the *write once - run everywhere* mantra, Java bytecode should make deployment easy. Classes are required in Java, for just about everything.
