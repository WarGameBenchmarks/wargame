WarGame Benchmarks
==================

WarGame Benchmarks contain multiple implementations of **WarGame**.

**WarGame** is a simple *kinda-sorta* benchmark that measures high level aspects of computer performance in terms of *games of war* per *millisecond*.

These are active WarGame benchmarks:

- [WarGame Rust](https://github.com/WarGameBenchmarks/wargame-rust)
- [WarGame Go](https://github.com/WarGameBenchmarks/wargame-go)
- [WarGame Java](https://github.com/WarGameBenchmarks/wargame-java)

These are implemented, but either outdated or broken WarGame benchmarks:

- [WarGame JavaScript](https://github.com/WarGameBenchmarks/wargame-javascript)

Please refer to each repository for status and other details specific to that implementation. Be sure to check the *Releases* page for ready to use binaries.

Generally, the output for each **WarGame** follows the same format. The [legend](legend.md) describes how to interpret the output.

We have [credits](credits.md) for various components of the project.
