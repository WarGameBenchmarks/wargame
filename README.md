WarGame Benchmarks
==================

WarGame Benchmarks contain multiple implementations of **WarGame**.

**WarGame** is a simple *kinda-sorta* benchmark that measures high level aspects of computer performance in terms of *games of war* per *millisecond*.

There are three active WarGame benchmarks available.

- WarGame Rust
- WarGame Go
- WarGame Java

There is one deprecated WarGame bench:

- WarGame JavaScript

Generally, the output for each **WarGame** follows the same format. The [legend](legend.md) describes how to interpret the output.
